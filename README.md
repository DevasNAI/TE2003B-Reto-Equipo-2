## TE2003 Dise√±o de sistemas en Chip Final project Repository
This repository serves as a tool for the final project of the Chip system design class, where we made an MP3 Player using an STM32F103 chip (blue pill) with an LCD and a 4x4 matrix keypad and played the musical content with a Raspberry PI 3 which had a UI where you could change the song and the volume.
### Files
The content in this repository is a list of songs with an mp3 format and a python script which executes the Serial communication with the blue pill and plays the music.
